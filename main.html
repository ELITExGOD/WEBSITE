    About you...
  </h4>

  <div class="love-note">
    <p>She is everything to me‚Ä¶</p>
    <p>I didn‚Äôt treat her the way she deserved. I didn‚Äôt realise her worth soon enough, and I took her for granted. But now I see. Bhagwan ne sab dikha diya ‚Äî He has shown me the path. And in that light, I see you as a goddess, Nikki.</p>
    <p>You are my world. I can go to any limits for you ‚Äî all I need is a chance. Even if you‚Äôve lost your feelings for me, I‚Äôll win them back.</p>
    <p>Remember the first time we hugged? You were so scared, so shy. That first ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù on the call ‚Äî we were just two kids in love, nervous and pure. Then came many more. Our first candlelight dinner, cake cutting, and lol ‚Äî I went on my knees to give you a flower üåπ That evening was perfect.</p>
    <p>Through every hardship, we bounced back. It was meant to be.</p>
    <p>I deeply apologise for the hurtful words. I regret them every single day. I wish I could go back in time. But now‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm better. I‚Äôm ready.</p>
    <p>Do you remember our first movie date? <b>Ant-Man & The Wasp</b>. You knew nothing about it üòÇ ... we were both so nervous. But god, you looked <i>stunning</i> that day. We watched each other more than the movie...right üòÖ</p>
    <p>Then we ate ‚Äî food lovers forever, my partner in crime, my partner in everything ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
    <p>You‚Äôve lost feelings, maybe. But god hasn‚Äôt let me lose hope. I believe He‚Äôs just testing me. And you‚Ä¶ you are the final exam. I hope I pass. You know I‚Äôve failed the major exam of my life once before...not again this is bigger than that ... thats what made me come to this clg and i was destined to meet u its all written üòâ</p>
    <p>Our city weekends, those activa rides, staying in OYO ‚Äî those were golden days.</p>
    <p>You‚Äôve always been my toughest competition üò§ But also the one I want to win for. And yeah, remember when <i>you</i> made a site for me? Now I had to compete ‚Äî here‚Äôs mine hahaha</p>
    <p>My <b>bachacha</b>, my baby‚Ä¶ losing you feels like losing everything. But I believe your feelings aren‚Äôt gone too far. I believe I‚Äôm not too late.</p>
    <p>If I am‚Ä¶ then I‚Äôll still do everything I can to earn you back. I <i>pray</i> to you like a goddess every day. I recite your name more than I speak anything else:</p>
    <p><b>Mi Amor. Nikki. My Bubu. My Chuhiya. Mera Bachacha.</b></p>
    <p>I love you so much. Please take this journey with me again ‚Äî one last chance. ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
